## Description
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

## Constraints
- Both ```l1``` and ```l2``` are sorted in ascending order.

## Important
- We need to think about the possibility that ```l1``` or ```l2``` can be empty.

## Example
Let's take two liked lists ```l1``` and ```l2``` where ```l1 = [1, 3, 4]``` and ```l2 = [3, 5, 6]``` and the values between ```[]``` represents the values in the nodes of each linked list.

We want to merge both list and keep the ascended order. So the result would be ```[1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6]```.
